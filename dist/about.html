                <p> I am an Anthropologist and a Librarian by profession. However, my interest has been broadened into multidisciplinary approaches. I Studied Journalism, Communication and Media at ISJC in Casablanca Morocco. I hold a BA. in Library Science and Book Jobs (Métiers du livre) From Hassan II University in Casablanca, Morocco in 2017. I earned my MA—degree in Cultural Anthropology from Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in Budapest, Hungary, in 2020. I pursued my Ph.D. studies. In Library and Information Science, also at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) from 2020 to 2024. I worked as a Librarian in a specialized library in Casablanca. I did anthropological research on Gnaoua music, rituals, religious practices, and their cultural heritage in Khemliya village in Morocco. For my Ph.D. research, I investigated the role of public and community libraries in literacy in rural regions in developing countries. I published several articles and collaborated in book chapters using multiple methods and techniques, such as ethnography, quantitative analysis, etc. I believe in multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches in research, which help me widen my research interests and skills. I am currently interested in the African continent with a focus on the impact of libraries on literacy, Information literacy, Critical Information Literacy, and Knowledge Management. I also conducted sociocultural research as a free lancer while doing my Ph.D. studies.</p>
